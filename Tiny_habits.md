# Question 1
## Most Interesting Idea

The most interesting idea is that you don’t need a lot of effort to change your life if you start with tiny habits. You can set a very small goal, like doing just two push-ups, and do it right after an old habit, like brushing your teeth. By celebrating every small win, you train your brain to enjoy the new habit so it can grow naturally without stress.

# Question 2
## How to Use B = MAP

The B = MAP formula explains that behavior happens when three things come together at the same time:

- **M (Motivation)** – Your desire to do the habit. Since motivation changes, you should not depend only on it.
- **A (Ability)** – How easy the task is. Make the habit very small so you can do it even when you feel tired.
- **P (Prompt)** – A trigger or reminder. Connect your new habit with something you already do daily.

To make habits easier, focus on making them simple and attach them to a strong reminder.

# Question 3
## Why is Celebration Important?

Celebrating after completing a habit makes you feel happy. When you feel good immediately after doing something, your brain connects that positive feeling with the habit. This makes it easier to repeat. Habits grow faster when they are linked with positive emotions.
